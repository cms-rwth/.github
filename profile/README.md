## Hello world
We are physicists at [RWTH-Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/ydc/lidx/1) working at [CMS experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) at CERN.
We analyze the data collected by the Experiment in order to measure the properties of the recently discovered [Higgs boson](https://cms.cern/physics/higgs-boson). 
In particular the [coupling of the Higgs boson to charm quarks](https://cms.cern/news/how-charming-higgs-boson) is a top interest in our group.
